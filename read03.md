 # Chapter 1- Structure

+ **HTML**hyper text markup language 
+ **HTML** pages are text documents
+ **Html** use tags like opening tags and end tags

1. `<head>` appears at the top of search engines only and does not appear on the page

2. `<body>`In this part, all its contents appear on the page, which can be viewed by the user and may contain several tags of it

### DOCTYPEs
  because there have been several versions of HTML, each web page should begin with a DOCTYPE declaration to tell a browser which version of HTML the page is using the use of a DOCTYPE can also help the browser to render a page correctly.
  
### Comments in HTML
 comments are not visible to users in the main browser window, they can be viewed by anyone who looks at the source code behind the page.

 + Syntax

 `<!-- comment goes here -->`

### ID Attribute
Every HTML element can carry the id attribute. It is used to uniquely identify that element from other elements on the page. Its value should start with a letter or an underscore (not a number or any other character).

It is important that no two elements on the same page have the same value for their id attributes (otherwise the value is no longer unique).

### Class attribute 
Every HTML element can also carry a class attribute. Sometimes, rather than uniquely identifying one element within a document, you will want a way to identify several elements as being different from the other elements on the page.

### Block Elements
Some elements will always appear to start on a new line in the browser window. 
+ Examples of block elements are`<h1> ` ` <p> ` ` <ul> `   `<li> `
### Inline Elements
Some elements will always appear to continue on the same line as their neighbouring elements.
+ Examples of inline elements are  `<a> `  `<b> `  `<em> ` `<img> `

### IFrames

An iframe is like a little window that has been cut into your page â€” and in that window you can see another page. The term iframe is an abbreviation of inline frame.
