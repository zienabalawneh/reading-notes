# When we talk about a growth mindset, we must talk about several elements associated with it:
* **Challenges**
 You must challenge yourself and believe that through challenges and difficulties you will acquire a new skill
* **obstacles**
 You must try to convince yourself that you are capable of removing obstacles
 ***effort**
 To make all your efforts to develop yourself and acquire new skills, because from the effort  generate experiences
* **criticize**
 You should not be negative and criticize everything in a negative way. Instead, it is better to say what you achieved today, what skills you acquired, and where were the      weaknesses to improve
* **Others'success**
  The success of others does not mean that I will fail. Their success should be an incentive to develop myself and to work as a team with others because our success is one.

**My story with the mentality of growth occurring every day by challenging myself to do whatever is required,I was studying computer science and  databases learning was a hindrance for me and my attempts to remove this obstacle by developing my skills and even being able to create a database in my graduation project which was very fun is working with the team on a project because we will succeed together and every time I fail I try again because every new attempt for me is to acquire a new skill.**
