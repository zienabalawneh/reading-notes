## Give a real world example.
1. MySQL Community Edition
2. MS-SQL Server Express Edition

## What kind of data is a good fit a NoSQL database?

+ But, NoSQL database fits better for the hierarchical data storage as it follows the key-value pair way of storing data similar to JSON data.

## Give a real world example.

## Which type of database is best for hierarchical data storage?

+ SQL databases are not best fit for hierarchical data storage. But, NoSQL database fits better for the hierarchical data storage as it follows the key-value pair way of storing data similar to JSON data. NoSQL database are highly preferred for large data set (i.e for big data). Hbase is an example for this purpose.

## Which type of database is best for scalability?

+  In most typical situations, SQL databases are vertically scalable. You can manage increasing load by increasing the CPU, RAM, SSD, etc, on a single server. On the other hand, NoSQL databases are horizontally scalable. You can just add few more servers easily in your NoSQL database infrastructure to handle the large traffic.
