#  Programming with JavaScript
A script is a series of instructions that the computer can follow in order to achieve a goal. 
**JavaScript** allows you to make web pages more interactive by modifying the contents, reflecting that modification on the web page, and responding to what the user is doing.
+ JavaScript is used to add or remove elements, attributes, and text to the page, for example:
     + Change the size or position of the `<img>` element

**Html elements are added to the content of a page to discribe its structure**
+ We are using Javascript when a certain event occurs. For example, it can be triggered when:
 1. A button is pressed
 2. The link is clicked (or clicked) on
 3. The information is added to a form

### EXAMPLES OF JAVASCRIPT IN THE BROWSER 
 1. Access the content of the page 
 2. Modify the content of the page 
 3. Program rules or instructions the browser can follow 
 4. React to events triggered by the user or browser 

### SLIDESHOWS 
Slideshows can display a number of different images  (or other HTML content) within the same space  on a given page.They allow more content to be displayed within a limited amount of space. 

 1. React: Script triggered when the page loads 
 2. Access: Get each slide from the slideshow 
 3. Modify: Only show the first slide (hide others) 
 4. Program: Set a timer: when to show next slide 
 5. Modify: Change which slide is shown 
 6. React: When user clicks button for different slide 
 7. Program: Determine which slide to show 
 8. Modify: Show the requested slide
### FORMS 
 Validating forms (checking whether they have been  filled in correctly) is important when information is supplied by users. JavaScript lets you alert the user if mistakes have been made. 
  1. React: User presses the submit button when they have entered their name 
  2. Access: Get value from form field 
  3. Program: Check that the name is long enough 
  4. Modify: Show a warning message if the name is not long enough
### RELOAD PART OF PAGE 
  You might not want to force visitors to reload the  content of an entire web page, particularly if you only need to refresh a small portion of a page. Just reloading a section of the page can make a site feel like it is faster to load and more like an application. 
   1. React: Script triggered when user clicks on link 
   2. Access: The link that they clicked on 
   3. Program: load the new content that was requested from that link 
   4. Access: Find the element to replace in the page 
   5. Modify: Replace that content with the new content 
### FILTERING DATA  
   If you have a lot of information to display on a page, you can help users find information they need by providing filters. 


**variable:its somthing that stores values**
**using the `var` keyword the only way to declare a JavaScript variable.**
All JavaScript variables must be identified with unique names.These unique names are called ***identifiers***.

+ The general rules for constructing names for variables (unique identifiers) are:

  1. Names can contain letters, digits, underscores, and dollar signs.
  2. Names must begin with a letter
  3. Names are case sensitive (y and Y are different variables)
  4. Reserved words (like JavaScript keywords) cannot be used as names



| Data Types    |              Example                      | 
| :---          |             :----:                        |            
|    String     |     'hello', "hello world!"               | 
|    Number     |            3, 3.234                       | 
|    Boolean    |          true and false                   | 
|    Object     |         let student = { };                | 





	
	
| Code  |      Result        | 
| :---  |      :----:        |
|  \b   |Backspace           | 
|  \f   |Form Feed           | 
|  \n   |New Line            | 
|  \r   |Carriage Return     | 
|  \t   |Horizontal Tabulator| 
|  \v   |Vertical Tabulator  | 

#### OPERATORS 
Expressions rely on things called operators; they allow programmers to create a single value from one or more values. 
  
  
 **Arithmatic Operators**
| Operator  | Description   | 
| :---      |   :----:      |
|   +       |Addition       | 
|   -       |Subtraction    | 
|   *       |Multiplication | 
|   **      |Exponentiation | 
|   /       |Division       | 
|   %       |ModulusVer     | 
|   x++     |x+1            | 
|   x--     |x-1            | 
|   x+=1    |x=x+1          | 
|   x-=1    |x=x-1          | 



**Comparison Operators**
| Operator  |        Description                 | 
| :---      |          :----:                    |
|   ==      |	equal to                           | 
|   ===     |equal value and equal type          | 
|   !=      |	not equal                          | 
|   !==     |not equal value or not equal type	 | 
|   >       |greater than	                       | 
|   <       |less than	                         | 
|   >=      |greater than or equal to	           | 
|   <=      |less than or equal to               | 
	

**JavaScript Comments**


Single line comments start with //.


Multi-line comments start with /* and end with */.
