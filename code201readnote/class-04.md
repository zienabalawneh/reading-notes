# HTML Links, JS Functions, and Intro to CSS Layout
# **HTML BOOK**
## Chapter 4: Ch.4 “Links” 

#### HTML Links

`<a href="https://web.facebook.com/?_rdc=1&_rdr">facebook</a>`

+ HTML links are hyperlinks.

+ Links are found in nearly all web pages. Links allow users to click their way from page to page.

+ You can click on a link and jump to another document.

+ When you move the mouse over a link, the mouse arrow will turn into a little hand.

+ The most important attribute of the <a> element is the href attribute, which indicates the link's destination 


1. Use the `<a> `element to define a link
2. Use the href attribute to define the link address
3. Use the target attribute to define where to open the linked document
4. Use the `<img>` element (inside `<a>`) to use an image as a link
5. Use the mailto: scheme inside the href attribute to create a link that opens the user's email program



## Chapter 15: Ch.15 “Layout” 

+ how to control where each element sits on a page and how to create attractive page layouts.

+ Websites often display content in multiple columns (like a magazine or a newspaper).

#### HTML Layout Techniques
+ There are four different techniques to create multicolumn layouts. Each technique has its pros and cons:

1. CSS framework:

If you want to create your layout fast, you can use a CSS framework, like  Bootstrap.

2. CSS float property

It is common to do entire web layouts using the CSS float property. Float is easy to learn - you just need to remember how the float and clear properties work. Disadvantages: Floating elements are tied to the document flow, which may harm the flexibility.

3. CSS flexbox

Use of flexbox ensures that elements behave predictably when the page layout must accommodate different screen sizes and different display devices.

4. CSS grid

The CSS Grid Layout Module offers a grid-based layout system, with rows and columns, making it easier to design web pages without having to use floats and positioning.

#### Key Concepts in Positioning Elements

##### positioning schemes
1. normal flow
2. relative position
3. absolute position
4. fixed position
5. floating position


+ `<div>` we use it to containing elements to group section of the page .

+ browser display pages in *normal flow* until we change it to *relative* ,*absolute* or *fixed position*.

+ use *float* to moves the content to the left or right of the page .

# **JS BOOK**

#### **Functions**
+ A JavaScript function is a block of code designed to perform a particular task.

+ A JavaScript function is executed when "something" invokes it (calls it).



`function name(parameter1, parameter2, parameter3) {`

  `// code to be executed`

`}`

+ A JavaScript function is defined with the function keyword, followed by a **name**, followed by parentheses ().


+ Function **names**can contain letters, digits, underscores, and dollar signs (same rules as variables).


+ The parentheses may include parameter names separated by commas:(**parameter1**, **parameter2**, ...)


+ The code to be executed, by the function, is placed inside curly brackets: {}

#### parameters VS arguments

+ Function **parameters** are listed inside the parentheses () in the function definition.


+ Function **arguments** are the values received by the function when it is invoked.




**Why Functions?**

1. You can reuse code: Define the code once, and use it many times.

2. You can use the same code many times with different arguments, to produce different results.


**Function Return** 

When JavaScript reaches a return statement, the function will stop executing.


If the function was invoked from a statement, JavaScript will `return` to execute the code after the invoking statement.



#### **varible scope**
1. local variables
2. global variables
