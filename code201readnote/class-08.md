#### Screen Sizes

+ Different visitors to your site will have different sized screens that show different amounts of information, so your design needs to be able to work on a range of different sized screens.

+ The size of a user's screen affects how big they can open their windows and how much of the page they will see. There are also an increasing number of handheld devices (mobile phones and tablets) that have smaller screens.

#### Screen Resolution

+ Resolution refers to the number of dots a screen shows per inch. Some devices have a higher resolution than desktop computers and most
operating systems allow users to adjust the resolution of their screens.


+ It is interesting to note that the higher the resolution, the smaller the text appears. Many mobile devices have screens that are higher resolution than their desktop counterparts.


#### Page Sizes

+ Because screen sizes and display resolutions vary so much, web designers often try to create pages of around 960-1000 pixels wide (since most users will be able to see designs this wide on their screens).


#### Fixed Width Layouts

+ Fixed width layout designs do not change size as the user increases or decreases the size of their browser window. Measurements tend to be given in pixels.

Advantages Fixed Width Layouts : 

● Pixel values are accurate at controlling size and positioning of elements.

● The designer has far greater control over the appearance and position of items on the page than with liquid layouts.


Disadvantages Fixed Width Layouts :

● If the user's screen is a much higher resolution than the designer's screen, the page can look smaller and text can be harder to read.

● If a user increases font sizes, text might not fit into the allotted spaces.


#### Liquid Layouts


+ Liquid layout designs stretch and contract as the user increases or decreases the size of their browser window. They tend to use percentages.


Advantages Liquid Layouts:

● Pages expand to fill the entire browser window so there are no spaces around the page on a large screen.



Disadvantages Liquid Layouts:

● If the user has a wide window, lines of text can become very long, which makes them harder to read.
